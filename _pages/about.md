I am a Cyber Security Researcher at [National Crypto and Cyber Security Agency (BSSN)](https://www.bssn.go.id/ "BSSN") worked mainly on a Red Teaming Project like Vulnerability Assessment, Penetration Testing to Website, API, Mobile (Only Android), and Infrastructure. Currently learning about Blue Team Project such as Secure Coding, End Point Detection Response and Infrastructure Hardening.

At this time, i am looking more opportunity to work on a cyber security project as a independent or freelance worker. with the knowledge as a BSc in Cyber Security Engineering that i got from [Indonesia Polytechnic Cyber and Crypto](https://poltekssn.ac.id/), i am willing to be an instructor for cyber security awareness or basic penetration testing.
