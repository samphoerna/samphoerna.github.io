I work as a Cyber Security Researcher at [National  Crypto and Cyber Security Agency (BSSN)](https://www.bssn.go.id/ "BSSN") primarily focusing on Red Teaming Project, including Vulnerability Assessment, Penetration Testing to Websites, APIs, Mobile Apps (specifically Android), and Infrastructure. Additionally, i am currently expanding my expertise to encompass Blue Team Projects, such as Secure Coding, End Point Detection Response and Infrastructure Hardening.

At this time, I am actively seeking opportunities to work on cybersecurity projects as an independent or freelance worker. With the knowledge acquired through my BSc in Cyber Security Engineering from [National Polytechnic Cyber and Crypto](https://poltekssn.ac.id/), I am enthusiastic about an instructor for cybersecurity awareness or basic pentest.
