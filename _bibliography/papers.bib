  abstract={The number of internet users internationally and nationally is increasing every year due to the development of increasingly advanced information and communication technology. The growth factor is due to wireless technology which is easy for everyone to deploy and use. This makes many users do not think about security in wireless network that they use. Penetration testing is solution to users who know about security vulnerability in network they use. Penetration testing is worked by pentester to find any vulnerability that can be exploited to take advantage of resource in the network. The test result will be analyzed by auditor to give best security recommendation for users Wi-Fi. However, the fact in the field is that there are challenge or difficulties when conducting penetration test, seeing that each vulnerability requires specific software and hardware. In this research, the design and development of a prototype system of automated testing tools on Wi-Fi network is implementing Evil Twin Framewok and NodeMCU ESP8266 as mobile and portable device. The results of testing and implementation show that the prototype system can perform penetration testing of evil twin attacks on a Wi-Fi network with power and computing resources from its own device.},
